    <p>Hello all! I am excited to get to know you all throughout this course.</p> 
    <p>A little about me. I am 29 and love spending time with my family, sports, movies and theatre. 
        I have been married to my wonderful wife Laura for about 18 months. She's the perfect wife for me 
        and I love her tons. In April we welcomed our amazing daughter Maggie. She is such a joy. I love 
        being her dad and all that comes with it. I love pretty much anything with a ball and some 
        competition. Football, baseball, soccer, golf and basketball are my main loves. But I'll never say
        no to playoff hockey and have recently started to get into Formula One racing. My family owned a
        movie theatre growing up which really informed my love of movies. I am a decent singer and am into
        all things theatre.</p>
    <p>I currently work in the equipment financing realm. It pays the bills, but I am looking for something
        more in my life. Coming back to school marks a big career shift for me as I'm diving into this new 
        field as a Software Development major. I hope to use the new skills and knowledge I gain to provide 
        more for my family. I can't wait to dive into all the aspects of this course.</p>
